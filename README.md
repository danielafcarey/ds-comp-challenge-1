# Countrypedia (Turing Static Comp Challenge #1)

## Synopsis
[Countrypedia](https://danielafcarey.github.io/ds-comp-challenge-1/) is a static design for a country information database. The layout was recreated based on the project specs (see Inspiration below) and the product concept was inspired by me wanting a resource for reading country info that is prettier than Wikipedia. 

### Inspiration
**Turing School of Software & Design Front-End Engineering Project - Mod 1:** Recreate the [given static comp](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html). Creative liscense given on copy, images, icons, color palette. Site must be responsive and be hosted on Github pages.
